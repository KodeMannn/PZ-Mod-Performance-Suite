**PZ-Mod-Performance-Suite** is a fast, standalone diagnostic scanner and 1-click optimization toolkit engineered to identify and eliminate micro-stutters, FPS hitching, Lua frame budget overflows, and Java garbage collection freezes in Project Zomboid.

Whether you're running a heavily modded singleplayer save or hosting a dedicated multiplayer server, **PZ-Mod-Performance-Suite** audits active mods across all your Steam libraries, classifies harmless localization merges from high-risk executable script conflicts, and applies verified low-latency engine tuning.

> ℹ️ **Disclaimer:** This project was designed and developed by [@KodeMannn](https://github.com/KodeMannn) with the coding assistance and pair-programming of **Google Gemini**.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 🪟 Windows (One-Click Executable)
1. **Download**: Grab [`Scan-PZModPerformance.bat`](https://github.com/KodeMannn/PZ-Mod-Performance-Suite/releases/latest) (single-file, zero dependencies).
2. **Run**: Double-click `Scan-PZModPerformance.bat` anywhere on your computer (Desktop, your `Zomboid` folder, or server directory).
3. **Choose Option**: Use the interactive terminal menu to run a full diagnostic scan, apply 1-click JVM GC optimization, set safe frame caps, clean ghost mods, or revert changes.
4. **Play Smooth**: Review the color-coded report before surviving Kentucky with zero micro-stutters.

### 💻 PowerShell / CLI Power Users
Run interactive or automated scans with command-line flags:
```powershell
# Interactive menu:
.\Scan-PZModPerformance.ps1

# Non-interactive automatic scan:
.\Scan-PZModPerformance.ps1 -Auto

# Audit a dedicated server config:
.\Scan-PZModPerformance.ps1 -ServerConfig "$env:USERPROFILE\Zomboid\Server\servertest.ini"

# Apply 1-click JVM garbage collection fix:
.\Scan-PZModPerformance.ps1 -FixGC

# Apply safe 120 FPS cap:
.\Scan-PZModPerformance.ps1 -CapFPS 120

# Clean ghost mods from current save:
.\Scan-PZModPerformance.ps1 -CleanSave

# Revert all changes and restore original backups:
.\Scan-PZModPerformance.ps1 -Revert All
```

> **Zero Dependencies:** Requires no installation, no extra modules, and no separate `.ps1` file. Runs out-of-the-box on Windows 10 & 11 via native PowerShell-Batch polyglot execution.

## 🔍 Key Features

* **⚡ Ultra-Fast Multi-Library Workshop Indexing:** Finds mods across all Steam drives (`C:`, `D:`, `E:`, `H:`, external NVMe SSDs) via `libraryfolders.vdf`.
* **⏱️ Potential Frame Spike & Stutter Prediction Engine (v2.2.0):** Estimates concrete freeze durations based on asset weight and code intensity:
  * `~350-550 ms [Severe Freeze]`: Massive 3D model injections causing chunk meshing stalls.
  * `~100-250 ms [Noticeable Hitch]`: Heavy texture packs causing VRAM paging spikes.
  * `~50-150 ms [Action Spike]`: High-volume transient hooks triggered by player actions (e.g. transcribing XP).
  * `~10-35 ms [Combat Hitch]`: High-frequency world square / zombie entity scans during horde combat.
  * `< 1 ms [Imperceptible]`: Harmless UI, texture replacements, or benign passive mods.
* **📈 Continuous Frame Time Tax (+ms/frame):** Calculates exact persistent CPU cost added to every frame budget (e.g., `+1.38 ms/frame`).
* **🎯 Stutter Trigger Scenario Classification:** Identifies exact gameplay triggers causing lag (`Chunk Border Traversal & High-Speed Driving`, `Horde Proximity & Combat`, `Action: Transcribing / Reading XP`, `Vehicle Spawn & Streaming`, etc.).
* **🔗 Runtime Telemetry Correlation:** Correlates real recorded `Worst Frame Spike` in `console.txt` directly with the top predicted offender mod.
* **🧠 Intelligent Semantic Lua Auditor:** Evaluates Lua code semantics to differentiate:
  * **Permanent Loops:** Unconstrained hooks executing every frame at 100–240 FPS (heavily penalized).
  * **Transient Hooks:** Self-terminating hooks with `.Remove` calls (UI listeners, 1-tick bootstrappers, retry loops) that cost virtually zero at runtime.
  * **Throttled / Gated Handlers:** Hooks gated by modulo counters (`% 30`), interval timers (`counter >= 500`), or idle state returns (`if n == 0 return`).
* **📁 Build 42 Version-Aware Deduplication:** Accurately targets the active version subfolder (e.g. `42.20` or `42.14` + `common/`), eliminating 2x–3x score inflation from historical version directories.
* **🎯 In-Hook Query Separation:** Distinguishes high-frequency per-frame world queries (`getZombieList`, `getSquare`) from harmless interactive queries executed only when clicking context menus or crafting.
* **🛠️ Local Workshop Staging Audit:** Directly scans custom mods being authored in your local `Zomboid\Workshop` folder without needing an active save.
* **🎨 Texture & VRAM Bloat Measurement:** Measures `.pack` texture archives and raw `.png` footprints, warning when mods consume excessive graphics memory (>100MB).
* **🛡️ Intelligent Conflict & Override Classifier:** Automatically classifies mod file overlaps into:
  * **Safe (Translations & Shared UI):** Verifies harmless localization dictionary merges (`/translate/`), shared category icons, and Git metadata.
  * **High Risk (Executable Lua Overrides):** Isolates direct Lua code replacements (`client/`, `server/`, `shared/`) that can break gameplay mechanics or cause multiplayer desyncs.
* **👻 Ghost Mod Filtering:** Automatically skips uninstalled mods from the performance audit so phantom references in `mods.txt` don't distort risk scores.
* **⚙️ 1-Click JVM Garbage Collection Tuning:** Patches `ProjectZomboid64.json` to low-latency G1GC (`-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=5`, `-Dpzopt.gc=g1`, `-Xmx16g`) with automatic `.bak` backup to eliminate 200–400ms complete freezes.
* **🎯 Safe Frame Rate Limiter:** Easily switches `frameRate` in `options.ini` between 60, 120, 144, or custom FPS to avoid running tick hooks 240 times/sec.
* **🧹 Savegame Ghost Mod Cleaner:** Automatically discovers and removes deleted mods from active save files (`mods.txt`).
* **🔄 Full Rollback & Revert Engine:** Restore any optimization back to original vanilla defaults with a single keypress.
* **📝 Markdown & Discord Export:** Generates rich markdown reports and a copy-pasteable summary block for Discord/Reddit community troubleshooting.

## 🛡️ Bottleneck Detection & Risk Matrix

| Bottleneck Category | Engine Impact | Severity | Primary Culprits |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VRAM & Chunk Meshing Choke** | Stalls render thread for 350–550ms when moving across chunk boundaries | **CRITICAL** | Massive 3D model injection packs (10,000+ models, >150MB textures) |
| **Unconstrained Permanent Lua Loops** | Consumes main-thread CPU budget running Lua calculations 240 times/sec | **CRITICAL** | Heavy `OnTick`, `OnPlayerUpdate` loops without throttle guards |
| **Java GC Memory Sweeps** | Freezes entire world for 200–400ms during garbage collection | **HIGH RISK** | Oversized heap (`-Xmx32g`), ZGC pauses under Lua table churn |
| **Missing Asset / Error Floods** | Floods `console.txt` with template syntax & missing asset disk logging | **HIGH RISK** | Outdated vehicle or animation templates in Build 42 |
| **Direct Lua Script Collisions** | One mod silently overrides another mod's script logic | **HIGH RISK** | Overlapping files in `media/lua/client/` or `server/` |
| **Per-Frame World Entity Queries** | High CPU cost continuously scanning zombies/squares in radius inside tick loops | **MODERATE** | In-hook `getZombieList()`, `getSquare()` loops |
| **Throttled / Periodic Handlers** | Minimal CPU cost executing only once every 30–500 ticks | **SAFE / LOW** | Modulo tick counters (`%`), timer accumulators, idle guards |
| **Transient Hooks & Bootstrappers** | Fires for 1 frame on boot or UI open, then calls `Events.*.Remove` | **SAFE** | 1-tick monkey-patches, UI listeners, action callbacks |
| **Localization & Icon Merges** | Standard dictionary merge; no gameplay logic altered | **SAFE** | Translation files (`/translate/`), shared category icons |

## 🛠️ General Optimization Recommendations for Build 42

1. **Cap Your Frame Rate:**
   If your display is 60Hz or 144Hz, do not leave your frame rate uncapped or set to 240 FPS in Project Zomboid's display settings. Setting a cap of 120 or 144 FPS instantly cuts Lua tick overhead by up to 50%.
2. **Tame Massive 3D Model Packs:**
   If your GPU has 8GB–12GB of VRAM and you experience 100–250ms hitches when driving into town or entering buildings, disable custom 3D voxel furniture packs while keeping your core camera/lighting mods.
3. **JVM Garbage Collection Tuning:**
   If you experience 200–400ms complete world freezes every minute or two, use Menu Option `[3]` or open `ProjectZomboid64.json` in your game install folder:
   - Reduce `-Xmx32g` to `-Xmx16g`.
   - Under `"windows" -> "10.0.17134"`, replace `-XX:+UseZGC` with `-XX:+UseG1GC`, `-Dpzopt.gc=g1`, and `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=5`.
